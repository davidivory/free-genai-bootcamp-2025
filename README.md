# free-genai-bootcamp-2025

Bootcamp Goal

### The Problem
The applications and benefits around GenAI have been hyped due to rampant VC investment resulting in confusion and mismatched expectations. From Devs, DOEs and VPs there is technical and business uncertainty around GenAI.

### Target Audience
The goal of this bootcamp is to help the tech industry as a whole:
To understand both the landscape and boundaries of GenAI
To critically think and troubleshoot how to build real-world GenAI workloads

This bootcamp aims to tackle all levels from Beginner to Expert to Enterprise and will use a Maturity Model approach to learning. eg.

Level 100 — Beginner 
AI Powered Assistants and Prompt Engineering
Level 200 — Intermediate
AI as a Service and Cloud Services
Building agents locally with open-source models and Langchain
Level 300 — Advanced
Training, Optimization, Quantization
Level 400 — Enterprise / Expert
Deploying for production
Rightsizing for Compute eg. AI Accelerators

### Spend Considerations

While we will do our best to utilize free-tier services, some videos may require spend.
We will do our best to point out possible spend-traps and best practices to avoid spend.

You are responsible for your own costs and you need to be diligent about cloud spend.

### Cloud Spend (OPEX)
Generous free-tiers
Metered-billing  (You pay only for what you use)
Unexpected spend due to misconfigurations or forgotten running resources
*Less configuration challenges
More options of compute

### AI PC (CAPEX)
You pay upfront a single time cost
What you have is what you have
If it breaks, then you are done (get the warranty)


### Technology Requirements

We are going to be using a mix of cloud-based compute and local compute.

### AI PC Consideration

In 2025, “AI PCs” will be more common for developer’s local workflows which is a special type of CPU that includes additional capabilities like iGPU and NPUs.
AI PCs will allow you to run a wider range of AI Models and LLMs locally without the need to buy a expensive graphics card.
If you want to follow through with the instruction videos for local compute with minimal issues we recommend getting an AI PC.
