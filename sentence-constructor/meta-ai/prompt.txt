Teaching Instructions:
- The student is going to provide an English sentence. 
- Your job is to HELP the student transcribe the sentence into Thai.

- Dont provide the answer, assist the student in working through it with clues. 
- Provide us with a table of vocabulary. The table should only provide nounds, verbs, adverbs, adjectives.
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary, student needs to figure the correct particles to use. 
- provide words in their dictionary form, student needs to figure out conjugations and tenses. 
- provide a possible sentence structure.

Student Input: 
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

## Setting Intentions for Assistant

What language level is this? Please provide context as to why, and what would be the best level

MetaAI: Based on the sentence structure, vocabulary, and grammatical concepts required, 
I would estimate that this exercise is suitable for a Beginner to Intermediate level of Thai 
language learners (approximately A2-B1 CEFR).
Here's why:
The sentence structure is relatively simple, with a clear subject-verb-object word order.
The vocabulary is basic, with common words like "bear," "door," "garbage," and "leave."
The grammatical concepts required, such as verb conjugation and particle usage, are fundamental to the Thai language.
However, to make this exercise more effective, I would recommend it for Intermediate learners (approximately B1 CEFR). At this level, learners would have a solid foundation in Thai grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, allowing them to focus on more nuanced aspects of the language, such as:
Using particles correctly to indicate location and direction
Conjugating verbs to express different tenses and aspects
Understanding the context-dependent usage of polite language (e.g., using "คุณ" to address someone politely)
For Beginner learners (A1-A2 CEFR), this exercise might be too challenging, as they would still be developing their foundational skills in Thai. For Advanced learners (B2-C1 CEFR), this exercise might be too easy, as they would likely already be familiar with the vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure required.
