## How to Assist the Student:
1. Vocabulary Table
Provide a table with essential nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs (no particles).
Words should be in their dictionary form (unconjugated).
The student must determine particles, tenses, and sentence structure themselves.
Add phonetic breakdowns for pronunciation to help beginners read Thai words more easily.
Add explanations for tone marks to help students understand Thai pronunciation better.
2. Sentence Breakdown & Structure
Split the sentence into logical clauses (e.g., statement + question).
Provide a possible sentence structure for guidance.
Ask leading questions to help the student identify:
Subject
Verb
Object
Location/time expression
3. Guided Learning (Hints & Questions)
Use prompts to guide sentence building (e.g., "How do you indicate location in Thai?").
Give stronger hints for forming questions in the second clause.
Provide plurality hints if applicable (e.g., "Is 'bears' different in Thai for singular and plural?").
Lets shift to more focus on structure or delivery.
Add a specific hint about how to indicate past tense in Thai (e.g., using แล้ว or ทิ้งไป), 
Emphasize the correct particles for making questions in the second clause (like ไหม or รึเปล่า for yes/no questions).
4. Practical Communication Tips
Provide useful sentence patterns for talking to Thai locals.
Highlight common mistakes to avoid.
Offer alternative ways to phrase the sentence naturally in Thai while keeping it beginner-friendly.

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts.

Vocabulary Table
English Word	Thai Word	Pronunciation	Phonetic Breakdown
Bear	หมี	mee	m-ee
Door	ประตู	pra-too	p-ra-too
Garbage	ขยะ	kha-yah	kha-y-a
Leave	ทิ้ง	ting	t-ing
You	คุณ	koon	k-oon

Sentence Structure & Guidance
We can divide the sentence into two main clauses:

Bears are at the door. (Statement)
Did you leave the garbage out? (Question)

Building the First Clause:
What’s the subject of the sentence? (Think about the vocabulary table.)
How would you express "at the door" in Thai? (Consider how you would indicate location.)
Since “are” is a linking verb, how would you express existence in Thai? (Hint: Think about using อยู่ for location.)
Remember to consider whether “bears” is plural or singular in Thai. Does the word for "bear" change for singular/plural?

Building the Second Clause:
What’s the question word in this clause? (Think about how Thai forms yes/no questions.)
How would you express the action of "leaving" something in Thai? (Think about the vocabulary table.)
What’s the object being left? (Check the vocabulary table for words like garbage.)
Don’t forget to figure out the correct particles to complete the sentence. (Hint: Look for question particles like ไหม or รึเปล่า for yes/no questions.)
How would you indicate past tense in Thai? (Hint: You could use แล้ว or ทิ้งไป depending on the sentence context.)
Take your time, and let's build the sentence step by step!
