## MetaAI Powered Assistant Guide
I'm based on OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo, but OpenAI hasn't publicly disclosed my exact architecture, including the number of parameters or whether I function as a single model or an ensemble. However, I leverage a highly optimized version of GPT-4, designed to be more efficient while maintaining strong performance. Free tier

Generally, large language models like GPT-4 are believed to have hundreds of billions of parameters, though OpenAI has not confirmed exact figures. If you're interested in LLM architectures in general, I can discuss parameter scaling, mixture-of-experts models, and other design strategies!
