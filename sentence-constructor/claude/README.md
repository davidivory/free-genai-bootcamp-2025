## Claude Powered Assistant Guide
I'm Claude 3.5 Sonnet, part of the Claude 3 model family released in 2024. I'm the newest version, released in October 2024. I aim to be transparent about my capabilities but don't discuss technical details like parameter counts, as those aren't public information.

The Claude 3 family includes:

Claude 3.5 Sonnet (that's me) - most intelligent model
Claude 3 Opus - excels at writing and complex tasks
Claude 3 Haiku - fastest model for daily tasks

You can access me through web, mobile, or desktop interfaces, or via API using the model string "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022". For more details about the Claude 3 family, I'd encourage checking the Anthropic website.

### Prompting Guides
For prompting guidance, here are some key techniques to get the most helpful responses from me:

Be clear and specific about what you want
Provide examples (both positive and negative) when possible
Break complex tasks into steps
Specify your desired format, length, or style
Request specific XML tags if you want structured output
