### Understanding Your Existing Structure

Your current structure suggests that:

routes/ contains API route handlers (groups.py, study_sessions.py, words.py).
lib/ might contain utility functions or shared logic.
seed/ may hold initial data seeding scripts.
sql/ is where database-related scripts reside (app.py, migrate.py).
requirements.txt contains dependencies.
tasks.py may handle background jobs.
